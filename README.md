Implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes using threads

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a very simple and efficient algorithm to generate prime numbers. This algorithm consists of removing the multiples of a determining set.
The operation can be seen through this animation below found in the article of [Eratosthenes Riddle of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
